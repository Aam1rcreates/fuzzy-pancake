<h2>Task Management API using Django Rest Framework with Authentication</h2>
<h3>Deploying the Backend API:</h3>

<strong>1. Choose a Deployment Platform:</strong> Select a deployment platform or hosting service, such as Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, or a web hosting provider. Your choice will depend on factors like budget, scalability, and familiarity with the platform.
  
<strong>2. Set Up the Deployment Environment: </strong>  Prepare the deployment environment on the chosen platform. This may involve creating a server, database, and configuring any necessary services (e.g., database server, web server, reverse proxy).
  
<strong>3. Database Setup:</strong> If you're using a different database in production than in development, configure the production database settings in your project's settings.py. Ensure the database is set up and accessible.

<strong>4. Environment Variables:</strong> Store sensitive information, such as secret keys and API tokens, as environment variables. Do not hardcode them in your project settings. Most hosting platforms provide a way to set environment variables.

<strong>5. Static Files:</strong>If you have static files (e.g., media uploads, CSS, JavaScript), configure the platform to serve them efficiently. For example, use a web server or a content delivery network (CDN).

<strong>6. Collect Static Files:</strong> Run <italics>`collectstatic`</italics> to gather static files into a single directory for serving. This command copies your project's static files to a location specified in your settings.
   ````  
python manage.py collectstatic
  ````
<strong>7. Web Server Configuration:</strong> Configure the web server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI) to serve your Django application. You may need a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to handle requests.

<strong>8. HTTPS (SSL/TLS):</strong> Set up HTTPS for secure communication. Most hosting platforms provide options for obtaining SSL/TLS certificates.

<strong>9. Django Settings:</strong> Adjust your project's settings.py file for production. For instance, set the DEBUG setting to False, and configure allowed hosts.

<strong>10. Deployment Scripts:</strong> Create deployment scripts or use deployment tools like Fabric, Ansible, or Docker to automate deployment tasks.

<strong>11. Database Migration:</strong> Apply database migrations to create the production database schema and populate it with initial data.
````
  python manage.py migrate
````

<h3>Adding Frontend to the Project:</h3>
If you later decide to add a frontend to your project, follow these steps:

<strong>1. Create a Frontend Directory:</strong> Create a new directory within your project to hold frontend-related code. You might name it something like "frontend" or "client."

<strong>2. Choose a Frontend Framework:</strong> Decide whether you want to build a frontend using a JavaScript framework or library (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) or use server-side rendering with a template engine like Django's built-in templating.

<strong>3. Set Up Frontend Development Environment:</strong> Install the necessary tools and dependencies for frontend development. This may include Node.js, npm, yarn, or bun(faster than others and new in the market), and the frontend framework or library of your choice.

<strong>4. Write Frontend Code:</strong> Create your frontend components, pages, styles, and scripts. Interact with your Django API by making HTTP requests to the API endpoints.

<strong>5. Configure CORS:</strong> If the frontend is hosted on a different domain than the backend, configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in your Django project to allow requests from the frontend.

<strong>6. Integrate with the Backend:</strong> In your frontend code, use the API endpoints you defined in your Django project to fetch and send data. You can use libraries like axios or fetch for making HTTP requests.

<strong>7. Static and Template Files:</strong> If using server-side rendering, you may need to include the frontend static files and templates in your Django project, and serve them using Django's built-in mechanisms.

<strong>8. Frontend Deployment:</strong> Deploy the frontend to a web hosting platform, following the platform's guidelines for your chosen frontend framework. This might involve building and optimizing the frontend for production.

<strong>9. Configure URLs:</strong> Adjust your Django project's URL routing to include routes for serving frontend views or templates, if applicable.

<strong>10. Combine Deployment:</strong> Depending on your hosting setup, you may deploy the frontend and backend separately or use a single hosting solution that accommodates both.
