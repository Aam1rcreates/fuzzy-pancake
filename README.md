<h2>Task Management API using Django Rest Framework with Authentication</h2>
<h3>Deploying the Backend API:</h3>

<strong>1. Choose a Deployment Platform:</strong> Select a deployment platform or hosting service, such as Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, or a web hosting provider. Your choice will depend on factors like budget, scalability, and your familiarity with the platform.
  
<strong>2. Set Up the Deployment Environment: </strong>  Prepare the deployment environment on the chosen platform. This may involve creating a server, database, and configuring any necessary services (e.g., database server, web server, reverse proxy).
  
<strong>3. Database Setup:</strong> If you're using a different database in production than in development, configure the production database settings in your project's settings.py. Ensure the database is set up and accessible.

<strong>4. Environment Variables:</strong> Store sensitive information, such as secret keys and API tokens, as environment variables. Do not hardcode them in your project settings. Most hosting platforms provide a way to set environment variables.

<strong>5. Static Files:</strong>If you have static files (e.g., media uploads, CSS, JavaScript), configure the platform to serve them efficiently. For example, use a web server or a content delivery network (CDN).

<strong>6. Collect Static Files:</strong> Run <italics>`collectstatic`</italics> to gather static files into a single directory for serving. This command copies your project's static files to a location specified in your settings.
   ````  
python manage.py collectstatic
  ````
<strong>7. Web Server Configuration:</strong> Configure the web server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI) to serve your Django application. You may need a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to handle requests.

<strong>8. HTTPS (SSL/TLS):</strong> Set up HTTPS for secure communication. Most hosting platforms provide options for obtaining SSL/TLS certificates.

<strong>9. Django Settings:</strong> Adjust your project's settings.py file for production. For instance, set the DEBUG setting to False, and configure allowed hosts.

<strong>10. Deployment Scripts:</strong> Create deployment scripts or use deployment tools like Fabric, Ansible, or Docker to automate deployment tasks.

<strong>11. Database Migration:</strong> Apply database migrations to create the production database schema and populate it with initial data.
````
  python manage.py migrate
